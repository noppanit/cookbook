| Self-rising flour     | 2 tablespoons per piece   |        |

# Method

1. Mix flour and butter in a food processor (to save time).
2. Put the dry mix into a bowl and mix milk and egg
3. Mix the mixture as slow as possible. We need the air in the dough. It doesn't have to be completely mixed.
4. Move the dough to a cutting board and roll the dough out.
5. Use cookie cutter to cut out the scone. You need to hear the sounds `puff`. That means the scone will rise. Otherwise, the scone will be hard.
6. Bake at 200F for 12 minutes
7. Serve warm with clotted cream and jam.
